            stop some time then  periods had to
            exist. Beside I had always like the
            look of periods  and  I  liked what
            they did. Stopping sometime did not
            really keep one  from  going on, it
            was nothing that interfered, it was 
            only something  that  happened, and

            in  periods  and   I  used them.  I 
            really  never  stopped  using them.
