                I believe things happen for a reason, nothing is an accident, hence any obstacle is education if we are awake in the moment. Allowing ourself to see the learning, free from auto-judgment to live in the moment, to trust and feel free to manifest our true desires.
            </p>

                I believe every human has a unique make-up and unique talents, hence if we are aware of our true purpose, awake in the moment and follow our heart, great wisdom and a natural flow will occur in business and life.
            </p>
            <p id="manifesto3">
                I believe true happiness in life results from emotional self-understanding to be authentic in expression which is the real source of inner freedom and self-belief.
            </p>
            <p id="manifesto4">
                I believe the new consciousness is an auto flow, to achieve without strain and pushing, to stay relaxed is a choice if we achieve from a place of clarity in our personal foundation unleashing a natural passionate flow of intuitive success.
            </p>
            <p id="manifesto5">
                I believe when on purpose and in the present moment, a more intuitive balanced flow of success produces wonderful synchronicity and great satisfaction in life.
